# Ap-Star-Evolution
This project aims to estimate the main-sequence lifetimes of chemically peculiar Ap stars and predict when they will evolve into white dwarfs. Using a catalog of Ap star data, we derive stellar masses, estimate evolution times using stellar evolution models, and visualize the distribution of these timescales.
