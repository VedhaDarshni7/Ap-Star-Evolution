# Ap-Star-Evolution
This project aims to estimate the main-sequence lifetimes of chemically peculiar Ap stars and predict when they will evolve into white dwarfs. Using a catalog of Ap star data, we derive stellar masses, estimate evolution times using stellar evolution models, and visualize the distribution of these timescales.
# 🌟 Ap-Star Evolution to White Dwarfs

This project predicts **when chemically peculiar Ap stars will evolve into white dwarfs**, based on their estimated masses. We utilize stellar evolution models to compute main-sequence lifetimes and visualize the distribution of evolution timescales.

## 🔭 Overview

Ap stars (peculiar A-type stars) are interesting due to their strong magnetic fields and chemical peculiarities. Understanding when they transition to white dwarfs helps in tracing stellar evolution and enriching stellar population models.

This notebook-based analysis:

- Estimates stellar main-sequence lifetimes from mass.
- Identifies stars that have evolved into white dwarfs.
- Visualizes the estimated evolution times.
